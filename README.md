# Poemunity - React Application with Flux

This Bootcamp took place at Skylab Coders Academy (Barcelona) from the 6th of July to the 25th of September of 2020.

My final Project was a social poetry website made in 2,5 weeks with the following technologies and methodologies:

- JavaScript
- React
- Flux
- Node.js
- Express
- MongoDB & Mongoose
- SCSS
- Material UI
- Git & Github
- TDD & BDD Testing (Jasmine, Jest, Mocha, Chai)
- Agile (Scrum)
- SOLID principles

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

Important! You will need a local implementation of MongoDB. My database is called "poemsAPI" and my collection is called "poems".

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

From the frontend folder, runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.


From the backend folder, runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:4200](http://localhost:4200) to view it in the browser.


### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
